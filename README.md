# Cricket Score Prediction üèèüìà
## Overview
The Cricket Score Prediction project uses machine learning to predict scores in cricket matches based on historical data. By analyzing factors like team performance, player stats, pitch conditions, and match format, the project provides accurate estimates of total runs and match outcomes.

This project is a valuable tool for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and fantasy cricket players.

## Key Features
- ### Data Preprocessing:

  - Cleaned and prepared cricket match data for model training.
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical features.
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  - Uncovered key trends in cricket scores and their dependence on factors such as overs, wickets, pitch type, and opposition.
  - Visualized data using plots and charts.
- ### Machine Learning Models:

  - Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for predicting runs.
  - Classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM) for predicting match outcomes.
- ### Prediction Capabilities:

  - Predicts total runs based on the number of overs, wickets lost, and batting conditions.
  - Predicts match winners based on team stats and performance indicators.
## Technologies Used
- ### Programming Language: Python
- ### Libraries and Frameworks:
  - ### Pandas
  - ### NumPy
  - ### Scikit-learn
  - ### Matplotlib
  - ### Seaborn
- ### Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## How It Works
- ### Data Preprocessing:

  - Cleaned and transformed raw match data into a usable format.
  - Created features such as run rate, balls faced, and overs remaining.
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  - Identified trends such as scoring patterns in different match formats.
  - Visualized team performance, pitch effects, and match outcomes.
- ### Model Development:

  - #### Trained regression models to predict scores:
    - Input: Overs played, wickets lost, pitch type, etc.
    - Output: Predicted total runs.
  - #### Trained classification models to predict match outcomes:
    - Input: Team stats, current score, match format.
    - Output: Predicted winning team.

## Visualizations:

- Run distribution by overs (bar chart).
- Win probabilities by batting team (heatmap).
## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate live data streaming for real-time predictions.
- Add deep learning models for more advanced predictions.
- Build an interactive web app using Flask or Streamlit.
- Include weather and toss data for improved accuracy.
